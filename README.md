## Steps to get started

### Step 1
Run the following line in your CLI depending on your package manager.

pip:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow
```
conda:
```
conda install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow
```
### Step 2
Run the Fetch_Data.py in your CLI file first to get and save the MNIST dataset.

### Step 3 (optional)
Run the Training.py file in your CLI to train the model although this will take a wile and the difference you might get will not be very much or could be worse.

### Step 4
In the test.py file you can either test the neural network on your own images or you can test it on random images from the dataset
